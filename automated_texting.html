<div class="description">
  <p>
    <b>Idea</b>: When the phone enters into a given geographical location
    or makes a particular adjustment, the phone notifies others of this in
    some contextual way.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Scenario</b>: After landing at the airport in Toronto, John must let
    his buddy Nils know that he has arrived. Traditionally, John would have to
    let his friend know manually, while trying to pack up his stuff and
    debarking from the plane. What if John's phone could use its built-in GPS
    to determine John's location, detect that he's arrived at his home airport
    and text his friend? Entirely configurable and based on simple explicit
    instructions, this feature could automatically trigger the sending of
    messages based on geographic location. The right information is given
    to the right people at the right time, all automatically.

  <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
  <p>
    People are forgetful, and often otherwise occupied when they should be
    communicating. If their phones could communicate for them based on some
    level of situational awareness, the minds of those they’re serving are
    left at ease. Life goes much more smoothly when all the proper folks have
    the knowledge they need at the right time in order to react appropriately
    to the knowledge in a timely manner. Too much time is wasted sending “are
    you there yet” and “i’m here” kind of messages - let’s automate that.
    (Also, remove possibilities for Butler lies &mdash; users aren’t honest.)
  </p>
  <h3>Where we are</h3>
  <p>
    The infrastructure is in place for a system like this to exist; almost all
    smartphones have global positioning sensors built-in. While these, now,
    are generally used for generating directions on a map to a location from a
    user’s “current location,” there’s no reason this GPS system couldn’t also
    be used to trigger messages. What it now takes is access to the GPS and an
    app that can generate scenarios based on certain criteria or based on a
    previous situation that is, in a sense, “recorded.” Take arriving home at
    the airport as an example. The first time you use the system for this
    scenario, you would add a scenario that says every time you arrive at that
    airport and walk through a certain terminal for exiting passengers, a
    message is automatically sent out to your family to notify them of your
    arrival. Tie that into your flight data and it could even issue out an
    SMS with terminal/gate number so that whoever is picking you up can know
    where to be.
